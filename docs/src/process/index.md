# Development Process

The process used to develop Open MCT Web is described in the following
documents:

* [Development Cycle](cycle.md): Describes how and when specific
  process points are repeated during development.
* Testing is described in two documents:
  * The [Test Plan](testing/plan.md) summarizes the approaches used
    to test Open MCT Web.
  * The [Test Procedures](testing/procedures.md) document what
    specific tests are performed to verify correctness, and how
    they should be carried out.
