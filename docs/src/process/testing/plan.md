# Test Plan

## Test Levels

Testing occurs regularly during development, with varying levels of
completeness.

In order of decreasing frequency and increasing completeness, these
are:

1. __Pre-merge testing__: Performed before changes are integrated
   into the software.
2. __Partial acceptance testing__: A subset of acceptance testing
   performed at regular intervals.
3. __Acceptance testing__: Performed before a new release is considered
   stable.

Each level of testing is inclusive of the levels which proceed it.
