# Test Plan

## Test Levels

Testing for Open MCT Web includes:

* _Smoke testing_: Brief, informal testing to verify that no major issues
  or regressions are present in the software, or in specific features of
  the software.
* _Unit testing_: Automated verification of the performance of individual
  software components.
* _User testing_: Testing with a representative user base to verify
  that application behaves usably and as specified.
* _Long-duration testing_: Testing which takes place over a long period
  of time to detect issues which are not readily noticeable during
  shorter test periods.

### Smoke Testing

### Unit Testing

### User Testing

## Test Performance

Tests are performed at various levels of frequency.

### Per-merge Testing

Before changes are merged, the author of the changes must perform:

* _Smoke testing_ (both generally, and for areas which interact with
  the new changes.)
* _Unit testing_ (as part of the automated build step.)

Changes are not merged until the author has affirmed that both
forms of testing have been performed successfully; this is documented
by the [Author Checklist](https://github.com/nasa/openmctweb/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#author-checklist).

### Per-sprint Testing

### Per-release Testing
