An example plugin that integrates with public data from the Curiosity rover. 
The data shown used by this plugin is published by the Centro de 
Astrobiolog√≠a (CSIC-INTA) at http://cab.inta-csic.es/rems/

This example shows integration with an historical telemetry source, as 
opposed to a real-time data source that is streaming back current information 
about the state of a system. This example is atypical of a historical data 
source in that it fetches all data in one request. The server infrastructure 
of an historical telemetry source should ideally allow queries bounded by 
time and other data attributes.
